Responsive Page Example
==================

An example responsive web page built intentionally not utilizing a frontend framework (e.g. no Bootstrap, Foundation).  JS libs used: underscore and jQuery, with lots of from-scratch (including pagination!).  Note: 'from-scratch' for fun and coding practice - I'd partiularly not recommend coding pagination from scratch for 'real' projects.

Reload at a small screen width to see responsive table in action!

CSS minifed/combined with Sass.  JS left uncombined/minified for easier viewing.
